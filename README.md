# MoniWatch

This app is intended as a personnal exercise.
I wanted to discover dotnet and by doing something that would be useful for me and my family. The goal is to create an helper app to monitor our bank accounts and transactions on it.

The architecture I thought of is a REST API on a raspberry pi, with an embedded sqlite database. Connected on a local network.

I don't know a lot yet about dotnet environment and programming good practices in general so feel free to message me if you're
passing by and watching this !
